## **Project: E-commerce Data Analysis System**

### **Objective:**
The goal of this project is to analyze e-commerce sales data, focusing on customers, orders, products, and categories. You will be tasked with creating SQL queries to generate insights into customer purchasing behavior, sales trends, and inventory performance.

### **Step 1: Database Setup**

1. **Create Tables:**
   - **Customers**: Store customer details such as name, email, and registration date.
   - **Products**: Store product details such as product name, price, and category.
   - **Orders**: Store order details such as order date, customer ID, and total order amount.
   - **Order_Items**: Store details of each product in an order, such as product ID, quantity, and price at the time of purchase.

2. **Insert Sample Data:**
   - Populate the tables with sample data including customers, products, and orders. The orders should have different products, prices, and quantities.

### **Step 2: Reports and Queries**

1. **Customer Spending Above Average**
   - Identify customers who have spent more than the average total order amount.

2. **Total Sales Per Category**
   - Calculate the total sales (revenue) generated from each product category.

3. **Top 5 Best-Selling Products**
   - Identify the top 5 best-selling products based on quantity sold.

4. **Orders from a Specific Date Range**
   - Identify all orders placed within a specific date range (e.g., between January 1st and March 31st).

5. **Customer's Average Order Value**
   - Calculate the average order value for each customer.

6. **Concatenate Customer Names by Order**
   - Create a list of customer names who placed an order in a particular month.

7. **Products with Low Stock**
   - Identify products with stock below a certain threshold (e.g., products with less than 10 items in stock).

8. **Top Customers by Total Spending**
   - Identify the top 10 customers who have spent the most money on orders.

9. **Products Sold in Multiple Orders**
   - Identify products that have been sold in multiple orders.
